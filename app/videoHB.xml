VERSE 1
You know how I love you girl
Do it with a passion
Know I got in trouble for an Instagram caption
Looking for some action
Sick with the fashion
Million-dollar deals and you know I'm finna cash in
Yeah I might be late but it's still better than never
Know you need your space we still better together
Trillion dollar face you still kill them whenever
I step up in the place in that Black Means leather
Japanese styling
You know I be wilding
Pages of the Forbes and you know they profiling
Take you to an Island
Go on get your sun on
Chill with me
Get a massage with your bun on
Hair up, body catching rays in the heat
Beach bunny
You love the cash like Street money
They love my new song but they say the beat's funny
I don't need a beat though
We be in that heat though, chillin

HOOK
And we reign in the Sun
And our good times are second to none
We are the ones, the ones
We are the wonderful ones
And we reign in the Sun
And our good times are second to none
We are the ones, the ones
We are the wonderful ones

VERSE 2
Swore that my next girl be different from my ex one
Look beyond the flaws and you still find perfection
I'll be your protection
Way out in the deep seas
You don't need a life vest long as you keep me close to your heart
We be real smooth sailing
Go on let that summer dress fly over the railing
Loyal like a K-9, you know I'm worth the wait
Treat you like a queen so you know I'm worth the hate
Know they jealous
Know they see us living good
Came up from that one bedroom apartment in the hood
Uptown
Big dreams now we made it
Grilling now
Bottom 6 gold plated
Shining when I'm smiling it's the history I created
Living like a boss'll make these haters aggravated
So we stunting harder stacking dollars to the ceiling
We out in Jamaica though
What a good feeling we chillin

HOOK
And we reign in the Sun
And our good times are second to none
We are the ones, the ones
We are the wonderful ones
And we reign in the Sun
And our good times are second to none
We are the ones, the ones
We are the wonderful ones

BRIDGE
Good ain't enough when you know that you're the greatest
We be in the back seat thinking how we made it
Love to see your face when I wake up in the morning
You're mine, you're mine
You're mine, you're mine

HOOK
So we reign in the Sun
And our good times are second to none
We are the ones, the ones
We are the wonderful ones
And we reign in the Sun
And our good times are second to none
We are the ones, the ones
We are the wonderful ones]]>

            <title>Hernán Beiza - Wicked Game (Bass Cover)</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Cover of "Wicked Game" played by me, Hernán Beiza. Originally by Chris Isaak, "Wicked Game" is a song that became a hit in 1991. I think that this song is about an unrequited love or a break up of a relationship.
This song is always recognized by the people that walks along the beach in the summer nights in Papudo. Cheers to them!
